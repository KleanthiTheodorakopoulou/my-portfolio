        <h5>COLOURFUL PATTERN</h5>
        <p>I created a colorful, abstract pattern based on a 20x20 grid. Each cell is randomly subdivided into smaller sub-cells (1 to 4 rows and columns) filled with purple-based colors that vary slightly, resulting in a unique mosaic-like composition every time the code runs.</p>

        <p>In this project creates a grid of squares on a black background. When the mouse hovers over a square, the square starts rotating and turns red. Otherwise, the squares remain still with no fill color. The result is an interactive and dynamic visual effect, where the user’s movement creates motion and color changes on the canvas.</p>

        <h5>FRACTAL CITY</h5>
        <p>I created an abstract, recursive representation of an urban layout inspired by a fractal. Starting from a square canvas, the drawFractal function repeatedly subdivides the space into smaller squares, placing each time a colored central square (in random purple-pink hues) and two crossing roads (one horizontal and one vertical) to simulate city infrastructure. The recursion stops when squares become very small (under 12px), avoiding excessive detail. The result is a complex, geometric composition resembling a city map with roads and buildings, where the varying building colors suggest different functions.

<p>The central idea of our final project is the creation of a creative model for understanding the seismic phenomenon. Our aim is not prediction, but rather the exploration of a natural mechanism that goes beyond the static nature of classical representation.

We designed an interactive world map that displays seismically active regions and allows for active user participation. We selected five cities with a significant seismic history — Tokyo, Athens, Ankara, Mexico City, and Santiago — and marked them on the map with red dots.

When the user selects a city, they are transported to a new environment where information about the location and a notable historical earthquake is presented. At the same time, a simulation of how the city’s buildings at that time responded during the specific earthquake is displayed, highlighting the impact on the built environment.

Through this approach, our project serves as a tool for understanding seismic behavior across time and space. The user has the opportunity to compare the consequences of earthquakes in cities with different geographical, cultural, and architectural characteristics, enhancing awareness of the connection between natural phenomena and human-made structures.
