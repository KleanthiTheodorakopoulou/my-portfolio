      <p>I am a 1st year undergrad student at NTUA School of Architecture. This is my website for ARCH 4342 Computational Methods in Creative Arts and Sciences. Have a look at my projects. </p>

        <h5>Geometry Pattern</h5>
        <p>The picture above represent a symmetrical geometric design with clear lines and shapes.</p>

        <h5>Random Circles</h5>
        <p>In the second exercise i attempted to create random circles that cover the entire area of the canva.</p>

        <h5>COLOURFUL PATTERN</h5>
        <p>I created a colorful, abstract pattern based on a 20x20 grid. Each cell is randomly subdivided into smaller sub-cells (1 to 4 rows and columns) filled with purple-based colors that vary slightly, resulting in a unique mosaic-like composition every time the code runs.</p>

        <h5>Random Lines</h5>
        <p>In the second exercise i created random lines with different colours that cover the entire area of the canva.</p>

        <h5>Hovering Square</h5>
        <p>In this project creates a grid of squares on a black background. When the mouse hovers over a square, the square starts rotating and turns red. Otherwise, the squares remain still with no fill color. The result is an interactive and dynamic visual effect, where the user’s movement creates motion and color changes on the canvas.</p>

       <div class="four columns">
        <img src="images/FRACTAL CITY.png" class ="scale-with-grid">
        <h5>FRACTAL CITY</h5>
        <p>I created an abstract, recursive representation of an urban layout inspired by a fractal. Starting from a square canvas, the drawFractal function repeatedly subdivides the space into smaller squares, placing each time a colored central square (in random purple-pink hues) and two crossing roads (one horizontal and one vertical) to simulate city infrastructure. The recursion stops when squares become very small (under 12px), avoiding excessive detail. The result is a complex, geometric composition resembling a city map with roads and buildings, where the varying building colors suggest different functions.</p>

        <img src="images/SNAKE.png" class ="scale-with-grid">
        <h5>SNAKE</h5>
        <p>This is an interactive snake-style game where the player collects food to grow while avoiding building-like obstacles that cause a game over. The snake moves on a grid with wrap-around at the screen edges, and the game can be restarted by pressing the ENTER key.
